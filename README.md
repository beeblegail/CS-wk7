Dear All,
 
A nice quick prep for this week and my apologies to those who wanted to complete it earlier in the week. For the IGCSE Computer Scientists, there are some extension programming tasks.
 
1.)     Research Communication and Networking terminology by writing down definitions for the following in your book:
·       Terminal
·       Ethernet
·       Switch
·       Hub
·       Server
·       IP Address
·       Packet
·       IPv4 versus IPv6
·       Domain Name Server
·       Ping
2.)     EXTENSION - Look up the definition of a DDoS attack and write a few paragraphs on:
·       How a DDoS attack works
·       How critical services such as banking, military and government servers defend against DDoS attacks
3.)     SUPER EXTENSION
·       Choose a programming language other than Python
·       Write a program which outputs the following text:
·   “Hello, World!”
·   “This program has been written in <INSERT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE HERE>”
·   “-<INSERT YOUR NAME HERE>”
·       Please e-mail a working EXECUTABLE to me. I won’t be installing any software so I need to be able to run it straight away
4.)     SUPER DUPER EXTENSION – Write a program in Python (or other) which:
·       Takes in a number as an input
·       Outputs useful information about that number, such as:
·   Even/Odd
·   Prime
·   Square
·   … any other information you think would be useful such as triangular numbers etc…
·       Please e-mail your .py file as an attachment
 
Best Wishes,
 
Mr Boshoff
